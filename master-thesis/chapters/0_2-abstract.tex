\chapter*{Abstract}
The transition to a carbon neutral energy supply is one of the greatest challenges of our time. The energy transmission system plays a major role in enabling the usage of renewable energy resources. However, the growing demand for electricity requires expansion of the whole transmission system. The planning of grid expansion gets more difficult with increasingly decentralized and volatile electricity generation. Therefore, scientists developed automated planning tools to assist grid operators in planning grid expansion. To complement previous research, this work presents \textit{Ant Power Medium Voltage}, which focuses on target network planning of medium voltage grids via Ant Colony Optimization, a heuristic optimization method. Furthermore, the presented algorithm is tested and evaluated on a real world example and manages to find a solution which reduces the cost by 11\%. A parameter study is conducted to show the influence of the algorithms input parameters. Although limitations of the presented algorithm are elaborated, this work shows that Ant Colony Optimization is a promising tool to improve automated planning of electric grids.
