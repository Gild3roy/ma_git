\chapter*{Abstract}
The transition to a carbon neutral energy supply is one of the greatest challenges of our time. The energy transmission system plays a major role in enabling renewable energy sources to efficiently participate in the electricity mix. The growing demand for electricity caused by the increase in electric vehicles and heat pumps among others requires expansion of the whole transmission system including the middle voltage level. The planning of grid expansion gets more difficult with increasing decentralized electricity generation and controllable loads. Therefore scientists developed automated planning tools to assist grid operators in planning their grid expansion. Ant colony optimization is one of the heuristic methods, which performed well for many use cases. This work focuses on target network planning of middle voltage grids using ant colony optimization. To complement previous research, this work considers information from low voltage level about potentially benefiting grid restructuring. Furthermore the presented method is tested and evaluated on a real world example using realistic as well as worst-case scenarios.
